    "Graphics Processing Units (a.k.a. GPUs, graphics cards, video cards) allow computers to perform parallel computations on a scale that is simply impossible on most traditional processing units (central processing units, a.k.a. CPUs). GPUs have allowed faster data processing, rendering, training for machine learning algorithms, and more. Gaming on a low-spec potato laptop often hinders the smooth play of demanding triple-A titles due to hardware limitations. To cope, users must reduce graphics settings, sacrificing visual quality for better performance. However, some games may still remain unplayable, necessitating the exploration of less demanding titles or an upgrade to a more powerful system. Many game developers are even expecting players to have powerful machines as an excuse not to optimize their games to perform well on lower-end machines properly.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) As computer graphics continue to progress and games become more graphically intensive, demand for consumer-grade GPUs such as NVIDIA's Geforce lineup has only grown.\n",

    "When cryptocurrency became mainstream (around 2017), more people started mining cryptocurrencies with consumer-grade GPUs due to their unreasonable effectiveness compared to traditional processors and the lack of supply for ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) units specialized for cryptocurrency mining.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Cryptocurrency miners, along with the onset of the pandemic led to GPU supplies dwindling, leading gamers to start blaming cryptocurrency miners for GPU shortages and sky-high pricing by eBay scalpers.

    "We suspect that cryptocurrency miners do have some impact on GPU prices and supply (in that there is some positive correlation between cryptocurrency prices and GPU prices), though its impact is often exaggerated by gamers on online communities as external factors such as chip (semiconductor) shortages often have a greater impact on price and supply. We believe this to be the case because many vendors often place limits on how many GPU's customers can purchase at at a time, and many of the GPU shortages have happened to coincide with global chip shortages (that were not isolated to GPU's)."

The date, category, and name are strings, and the change and percentage are floats. This data will help us to understand the usage of particular GPU products over time.

This data will help us to understand how bitcoin prices fluctuate overtime.

    "Our data come from Steam surveys, eBay sales, and general finance data. All of these sources are easily-accessible and public information. Because the data from the Steam surveys is already anonymized, there should not be any ethical or privacy concerns with being able to extrapolate personal identifiable information from the survey data. However, this makes it difficult to account for any potential biases in the dataset as we can only guess at the demographic of Steam users who answered the survey. Additionally, in these types of surveys it is important to be aware of many different types of biases that may come into play, including non-response, self-reporting, and other confounding variables, which could lead to a disproportionate amount of high-end hardware appearing in survey results. When choosing to scrape data from eBay, we had to be aware of terms of service and other restrictions before choosing this as a source for our final dataset. Regarding eBay sales and finance data, we don’t anticipate any ethical or privacy related concerns in our use of the data since by nature it is anonymized. There is potential to be able to identify individual companies or investors through the data, one way to address this is simply aggregating data, since we only require a broader overview. There may be concerns as to how this data is acquired and any potential biases that may be introduced. To help detect these biases as we perform analysis of the data, we will be careful to thoroughly explore the data before deeper analysis, attempting to fully understand it and being careful to note factors that may indicate biases in the data. In our post-analysis, we will discuss the results of our exploration. If we suspect any biases, we will explain their significance and the impact on the results of our analysis."
