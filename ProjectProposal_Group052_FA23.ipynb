We believe this to be the case because many vendors often place limits on how many GPU's customers can purchase at at a time, and many of the GPU shortages have coincided with chip shortages.\n"

    "Our proposed data will mainly come from STEAM surveys, company sales, and general finance data. Because the data from the STEAM surveys is already anonymized, there should not be any ethical or privacy concerns with being able to extrapolate personal identifiable information from the survey data. However, this makes it difficult to account for any potential biases in the dataset as we can only guess at the demographic of STEAM users who answered the survey. Additionally, in these types of surveys it is important to be aware of many different types of biases that may come into play, including non-response, self-reporting, and other confounding variables. Regarding company sales and finance data, we don’t anticipate any ethical or privacy related concerns in our use of the data since by nature it is anonymized. There is potential to be able to identify individual companies or investors through the data, one way to address this is simply aggregating data, since we only require a broader overview. There may be concerns as to how this data is acquired and any potential biases that may be introduced. To help detect these biases as we perform analysis of the data, we will be careful to thoroughly explore the data before deeper analysis, attempting to fully understand it and being careful to note factors that may indicate biases in the data. In our post-analysis, we will discuss the results of our exploration. If we suspect any biases, we will explain their significance and the impact on the results of our analysis."
